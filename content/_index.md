This is my [GitHub About Me](https://github.com/SebastianErfort/SebastianErfort) imported and rendered using a [shortcode](https://blowfish.page/docs/shortcodes/#markdown-importer) - neat.

:construction: I'm currently building this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Blowfish theme](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish), building on GitHub and deploying to GitHub Pages for now.
