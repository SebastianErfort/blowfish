title: Website with Hugo and Blowfish theme
date: 2024-07-07

1. follow instructions in [Blowfish repo/on website][blowfish] to set up Hugo and theme
2. configure: files `config/_default/*.toml`
3. edit landing page `content/_index.md`

## CI/CD

I tried the suggested [GitHub workflow from the Blowfish docs](https://blowfish.page/docs/hosting-deployment/#github-pages), but I found the instructions a bit incomplete and possibly outdated. Checkout, setting up Hugo and building all worked fine, but deployment failed. The action used in this step noticed the `gh-pages` branch missing and created it, but deployment failed. I tried expanding the `permissions` for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `write: true`, created the missing branch in the repo (empty orphan) and tried deployment from the branch `gh-pages` as stated in the Blowfish docs.

In the end I went back to the workflow I had been using for my [previous website with the Hugo Clarity theme](https://github.com/SebastianErfort/homepage-hugo-clarity). I tidied that one, removing some unnecessary dependencies and setting up Hugo through an action. For now I opted for the latest version of Ubuntu and Hugo, might pin versions some time for stability.
